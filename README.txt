NFS Underground 2 - Extra Options - Build 2; Rev.01
Made by nlgzrgn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
(Almost every option can be edited from .ini file.)

-- (NEW!) You can enable subtitles for English!
> German, French, Spanish, all have subtitles. Why not English?
! Some subtitles are buggy because of their strings.

-- (NEW!) You can adjust the Neon brightness.
> See the .ini file!

-- (NEW!) You can use Carbon-Style race progress now.
> No more LAPS 1/1! You'll see % progress on 1-lap races now.

-- (NEW!) You can change the time limit of Splash Screen.
> 30 seconds aren't enough? Make it a minute, an hour, maybe a day!

-- (NEW!) You can enable Drift camera mode everywhere!
> Birds eye free roam? Yeah, it's here!

-- (NEW!) You can use "Powder Coat" and "High Heat" paint types as Base Paint.
> You can have nicer colours!

-- (NEW!) You can install Special Vinyls on your car now.
> Debug vinyl and sponsor vinyls, I've added them to the menu. Just go install them!
! Some vinyls don't work for some cars.

-- (NEW!) "Insert Disc" bug is fixed for PCs without optical drives.
> The game wants you to insert the disc even with a No-DVD crack? Now it's fixed, just run the game!

-- Lap and opponent count restrictions are modified.
> You can have from 0 (which makes the race unlimited) to 127 (Really long races) laps.
> Maximum opponents are now limited with 5 instead of 3. More than 6 players will crash the game.
! These options are valid for LAN races, too.
! (NEW!) Now you can select any lap and opponent count when "Lap KO" option is enabled.

-- Drift multiplier can now be modified up to x9.
> The default value was x5. You can revert it back if you want, or use x1 for more challenging drift races.
! (NEW!) Now with this hack, static drift scores (for Heights Drifts) are multiplied with Multiplier/5 (1.8 for x9) to balance them with you.

-- You can change the appearance of Drift Points.
> Add a + sign in front of them to make it like "Power Slide", "Hang Time" or "Hydros".
> Show it without multiplying, Instead of 1500, have it 500x3 like "Avoided Accident" or "Clear Section".

-- You can unlock cars from PAL version (Peugeot 106 and Opel Corsa) for the NTSC version of the game.
> They will be available at Customize Menu and Career Car Lot.
! You must have the files for these cars (PEUGOT106 and CORSA folders) on your CARS folder. Otherwise, this option will not work.
! I've also added an option to unlock all the cars from the beginning! (Start the career with a RX7, huh?)
! (NEW!) New method lets you see them as opponents, too!

-- You can select a track for Free Run (9) and Outrun (8?) game modes.
> They have a very long list! Just try it.
! (NEW!) You can add Outrun to Quick Race menu. But it's buggy there. You'll get a black screen with 2 player HUD.

-- You can have every track on every game mode.
> This will make the list too long. After some races, icons won't scroll. But you can select the races safely.
! If you select a track which doesn't exist in game files, your game will crash or get an infinite loading screen. Be careful with that.
! If you select a Sprint Drift (Heights Drifts) for another game mode, your game will crash when you finish the race.
> (NEW!) Now you can control it with a hotkey. Enable it when you want.

-- You can remove the neon barriers.
> Locked area barriers or route indicators, remove if you don't want them!
! (NEW!) This hack will be disabled for Drift, StreetX and URL tracks to fix invisible walls bug.
